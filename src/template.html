            You love having a second home but the mortgage is putting a crater
            in your wallet. Many second home owners turn to renting their
            property as a vacation rental to help defray the costs of ownership.
            How do you price a vacation home rental without overcharging but
            making enough to cover your costs? Do your research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find out what other owners of, similar sized homes in the area are
            charging. You can ask a local real estate agent for a price range,
            scan local papers or go online. There are also vacation rental sites
            like eVaca.com. These types of sites have advertisements from owners
            around the world and weekly rates for the properties are listed.
          </p>

            The time of year you rent out a property is important as well. If
            you want to rent out a ski lodge in Vermont, August is not going to
            be your “high time” of year, but January will. If you are going to
            rent the property in an “off” time of year you will not be able to
            charge as much as if you were renting the property in a peak time.
          </p>
          <p>
            You also want to figure out what lengths you want to rent your
            property for. A Florida property in July near the beach will go for
            top dollar for a week. However, that same property in January you
            might only attract the snowbirds who want to rent at a lower price
            and rent it out on a monthly basis. You have to answer questions
            like, “do I want to mess around with weekend or nightly rentals” and
            “is it worth the hassle”.
